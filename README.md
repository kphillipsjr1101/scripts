[This is a repository of scripts that I use regularly]

###It contains three sub folders [python], [powershell], and [bash]###

Each one contains scripts I use in the respective language.

I will try to keep this updated as best as possible with scripts I find or modify for daily use and you're more than welcome to contribute useful scripts for IT Automation
